# Hey, I'm Elliot 👋

### Retail leader turned full-stack dev, bridging people, tech & purpose

I'm a **Full-Stack Developer** with a background in high-performance retail leadership. After managing one of Vodafone’s top franchise stores (yeah, we won Store of the Year 🏆), I’ve spent the past two years *grinding code like it’s leg day*, and building real-world projects that solve real problems.

Currently building:
- 🎤 A **Singer portfolio** app to showcase music
- 📊 A **Sales Dashboard** for performance-driven teams
